            <p>AOK is the founder of the commission, as he calls himself "AOK the commissioner" as well as a lot of other monikers as "AOK the golden child" and  "AOK the artsist". AOK is a hip hop artist through and through with influences ranging from Nas to MI, and from Kanye to Lil Uzi. AOK also produces all his music, this is where 'AOK the artist' originates as to creating an entire song from a blank canvas as a painter would. </p>
